Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm JosÃ© De La Paz ðŸš€
I am a passionate Frontend Developer, proudly graduated from the Web Development School and the Frontend Developer program at Steam Academy, as well as Platzi's Web Development School. With over 8 months of teaching experience in web development, I have honed the skills to both craft exceptional user experiences and inspire others to do the same.

ðŸ’¡ Beyond coding, my professional journey includes extensive experience in sales and business, where I developed strong communication and problem-solving skills that complement my technical expertise.

ðŸŒŸ Iâ€™m also a proud advocate of capitalism and free enterprise, championing innovation and entrepreneurial spirit as essential drivers of progress.

When I'm not coding or teaching, you'll find me immersed in exciting projects, always eager to learn, build, and contribute to the community. Let's create something amazing together! âœ¨
